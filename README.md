## Description
This is an online store where users can browse products, add them to the cart, and search for products.
Objective:
The objective of the project was to design a software system for an online store that enables customers to search for products, add them to their shopping basket, and proceed through the checkout process. The system also supports third-party sellers who maintain their own product catalog, pricing, and storefront.

## Features

Customer Interaction:

Customers can search for products and add them to their shopping basket.
Products sold by the website and third-party sellers are available.
Out-of-stock products are marked as unavailable.
Checkout Process:

Customers proceed through the checkout process after finishing shopping.
They specify delivery details and choose from various delivery options.
Payment options include credit/debit cards, online payment services (e.g., PayPal), and gift vouchers.
Customers may use promotional codes and store payment details for convenience.
Order Processing:

Upon successful payment, orders are passed to warehouse staff for fulfillment.
Warehouse staff locate items in the stock database and package them for delivery.
Orders are updated in real-time as items are scanned and stock levels are adjusted.
Once packaged, orders are marked as ready for delivery.
Delivery and Shipping:

Orders are distributed to appropriate delivery companies based on customer preferences.
Different delivery options are available, including standard delivery and in-house courier service (for website products).
Products from third-party sellers are shipped through external delivery companies.
